        <strong>Understanding Endometriosis</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Endometriosis is a long-lasting health issue where cells resembling those that line the inside of the womb grow in other places within the body. These cells follow the same monthly pattern as the womb lining — they build up and try to shed — but since they’re trapped, this causes swelling, soreness, and the formation of scar tissue or sticky bands between organs.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        The growths are most often found around the pelvis, on surfaces covering the organs, the ovaries, tubes, intestines, or urinary bladder. In less common situations, they can appear farther away, such as in scar tissue from surgery or even in the chest cavity.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Around one in ten people who menstruate experience this condition during their reproductive years, though its effects can continue afterward. It touches millions worldwide, across every background and community.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Another related problem is <strong>adenomyosis</strong>, where these same kinds of cells grow into the muscular wall of the womb itself, often leading to particularly heavy and uncomfortable monthly bleeding. Many people have both conditions together.
    </p>

    <img src="images/guide-1.2-symptoms.jpg" alt="Visual showing where endometriosis tissue can develop" class="centered-img">

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Different Forms of Endometriosis</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Doctors classify the condition into four main forms depending on where the tissue appears and how deeply it invades. It’s common for someone to have a combination:
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        • <strong>Surface-level peritoneal</strong> — thin patches on the lining inside the pelvis<br>
        • <strong>Ovarian cysts (endometriomas)</strong> — dark-fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries, sometimes called chocolate cysts<br>
        • <strong>Deeply invading</strong> — growths that reach further into tissues, often involving the intestines, bladder, or area behind the womb<br>
        • <strong>Outside the pelvis</strong> — unusual locations beyond the lower abdomen, like the lungs or old surgical scars
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>How Endometriosis Can Feel</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Everyone’s experience is different. Some face intense challenges, while others notice very little. The strength of symptoms doesn’t always reflect how much tissue is present or where it is. Many of these signs can also appear with other illnesses, so it’s worth talking to a healthcare professional if they affect your daily routine.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Soreness — the hallmark experience</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        A deep, persistent ache in the lower abdomen is frequently reported, sometimes feeling like sharp stabs or heavy pressure that spreads to the back or legs. This often becomes far worse in the days leading up to and during menstruation. For many, monthly cramps are far beyond ordinary discomfort and can make normal activities difficult — yet they’re sometimes wrongly considered just part of having periods.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        The soreness doesn’t always end with the bleeding. People commonly notice:
        <br>• Discomfort during or following intimate moments
        <br>• Pain when passing stool or urine, especially around the time of a period
        <br>• Ongoing dull or intense tenderness in the pelvic region
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        When deeper tissues involve the intestines or bladder, additional troubles can include noticeable abdominal swelling, changes in bowel habits, cramps during bowel movements, or stinging when passing urine — issues that are sometimes confused with digestive or urinary disorders.
    </p>

    <img src="images/guide-1.1-symptoms.jpg" alt="Illustration of common endometriosis experiences" class="centered-img">

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Further common experiences</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        • Very heavy or lengthy monthly flow, often with large clots that make everyday tasks harder<br>
        • Lasting tiredness that feels overwhelming and isn’t fixed by sleep<br>
        • Challenges when trying to become pregnant (though many people still conceive without help)<br>
        • Feeling sick or throwing up near the time of a period<br>
        • Headaches that seem tied to monthly changes<br>
        • Aching in the legs caused by pressure on nerves<br>
        • In unusual cases, pain in the upper body or chest area
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Impact beyond the body</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Living with this condition can affect many areas of life — from studies and work to close relationships and emotional health. The uncertainty and ongoing discomfort can lead to feelings of worry, sadness, or being alone in the struggle.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        If these descriptions feel familiar, know that what you’re going through is genuine and matters.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Things worth knowing</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        • This condition is not cancerous, cannot be passed to others, and is not linked to sexual activity.<br>
        • Similar signs can come from other health issues — professional guidance is important.<br>
        • Various approaches, including medication for pain, hormonal options, or surgical procedures, can help improve daily life, even if it takes time to discover the best combination.

        <!-- Causes Tab -->
        <div id="causes" class="tab-content">
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>What Causes Endometriosis?</strong>             
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The honest answer is this: we don’t fully know yet.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Endometriosis is complex, and there is no single cause. Instead, it appears to develop from a combination of factors — different for every woman. Doctors and researchers agree on is that endometriosis is multifactorial, meaning genetics, hormones, the immune system, inflammation, and environmental influences all play a role.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Important: nothing you did caused this.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>A condition shaped by inflammation and immunity</strong>     
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Recent large-scale studies (2025) from institutions such as UC San Francisco, Oxford, and Yale suggest that endometriosis is closely linked to immune and inflammatory pathways. These studies also show overlap with other conditions like migraines, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune disorders, anxiety, and depression — helping explain why endometriosis often affects the whole body, not just the pelvis.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                This growing evidence is shifting how we understand endometriosis: not just as a gynecological condition, but as a systemic inflammatory disease.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Retrograde menstruation: one piece of the puzzle</strong>     
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                One of the earliest and most well-known theories is retrograde menstruation, first described in 1927. During menstruation, some blood flows backward through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity, carrying endometrial-like cells with it.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                This happens in most women — but in people with endometriosis, the body doesn’t clear these cells properly. Instead, they attach, survive, and continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>When cells change or travel</strong>     
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            Other theories help explain cases that retrograde menstruation alone cannot: <br>
                • Metaplasia theory: cells lining the abdomen may transform into endometrial-like tissue under the influence of hormones or inflammation <br>
                • Stem cell theory: embryonic or bone marrow stem cells may migrate and develop into endometriosis tissue <br>
                • Lymphatic or blood spread: cells may travel through blood or lymph vessels to distant areas, such as the lungs              
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            These theories help explain why endometriosis can appear in unexpected places — and even, very rarely, in men or before puberty.
            </p>
            <img src="images/guide-1.1-causes.jpg" alt="Causes of Endometriosis" class="centered-img">
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Genetics: a strong influence</strong>    
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            Genetics play a major role. If your mother or sister has endometriosis, your risk increases six to ten times. Recent genetic studies have identified variations in genes involved in inflammation, immune response, hormone signaling and tissue adhesion.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               The immune system, which should spot and clear these out-of-place cells, doesn’t work as it should: natural killer cells fail to destroy them, while other immune cells called macrophages actually help the tissue survive instead of removing it. This leads to ongoing low-level inflammation, driven by chemicals in the body like IL-6 and TNF-α, which encourage new blood vessels to form (angiogenesis) and create scar tissue (fibrosis). 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Everyday environmental factors can make things worse—chemicals like dioxins and phthalates (found in some plastics and products) can mimic estrogen or weaken the immune system. An unbalanced gut microbiome can add to whole-body inflammation, while oxidative stress and changes in how genes are switched on or off (epigenetics) also contribute. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Recent research from 2025 shows stronger links to autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as a possible connection with rheumatoid arthritis, opening doors to repurposing existing drugs. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               In the end, endometriosis likely starts with retrograde menstruation (cells flowing backward), combined with genetic vulnerability, immune system glitches, hormonal imbalance, and environmental triggers. The more we understand these pieces, the closer we get to new, non-hormonal treatments that target inflammation or the immune response directly—offering hope for gentler, more effective options. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Researchers have also found shared genetic links between endometriosis and autoimmune conditions (like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis), as well as mental health conditions — reinforcing that this disease affects the whole system. The main driver is estrogen—it acts like fuel, helping the misplaced tissue grow and spread. At the same time, the body often becomes resistant to progesterone (the hormone that normally keeps things in balance), so the tissue doesn’t respond properly and keeps building up.
           </p>
            <p class="body-text">    
                <strong>Hormones and immune imbalance</strong>    
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Estrogen is a key driver of endometriosis. It acts like fuel, encouraging lesions to grow and spread. At the same time, many women develop progesterone resistance, meaning the hormone that normally balances estrogen doesn’t work as it should.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The immune system also plays a role. Cells that should destroy misplaced tissue fail to do so, while others actually help the lesions survive. This leads to chronic inflammation, scarring (fibrosis), and the growth of new blood vessels that feed the disease.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Environmental and lifestyle influences</strong>    
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Environmental factors may worsen or trigger endometriosis in susceptible people. These include: <br>
                • chemicals that mimic estrogen (such as dioxins or phthalates) <br>
                • chronic stress <br>
                • gut microbiome imbalances <br>
                • oxidative stress <br>
                • epigenetic changes (how genes are switched on or off) 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                These influences don’t cause endometriosis on their own — but they may tip the balance in an already vulnerable system.

                New research increasingly links endometriosis to autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions, opening the door to non-hormonal treatments that target inflammation and immune dysfunction directly.

                <strong>Why diagnosis takes so long?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                One of the hardest parts of endometriosis is that symptoms don’t match disease severity. Someone with minimal lesions can experience extreme pain, while others with advanced disease may have few symptoms.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Because symptoms overlap with conditions like IBS, fibroids, or pelvic infections, diagnosis is often delayed 7–10 years. Many teens and young women are told their pain is “normal,” allowing the disease to progress.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>How to make a diagnose?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                For many women, the road to an endometriosis diagnosis is long, confusing, and emotionally exhausting. If you’ve ever been told “everything looks normal” while knowing something isn’t right — you’re not alone.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Diagnosis usually begins with listening.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Step 1: Your story matters</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The most important diagnostic tool is often a detailed conversation with your doctor. You may be asked about:<br>
                • When your pain started and how it feels<br>
                • Whether pain worsens during periods, sex, or bowel movements<br>
                • Your menstrual cycle and bleeding patterns<br>
                • Digestive or bladder symptoms<br>
                • Family history of endometriosis<br>
                • Fertility concerns<br>
                These patterns can strongly point toward endometriosis — even before any tests are done.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Step 2: Imaging tests</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                A pelvic exam allows the doctor to gently check for tenderness, nodules, or changes in the uterus or ovaries. However, a normal exam does not rule out endometriosis, especially in early or less advanced stages. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Step 3: Physical examination</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Most doctors start with a transvaginal ultrasound. When performed by a specialist trained in endometriosis, this test can detect ovarian cysts (endometriomas) and deeper lesions. According to the ESHRE 2022 guidelines, expert ultrasound is now one of the most reliable non-invasive diagnostic tools.<br>                    
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                If deeper involvement is suspected — such as in the bowel or bladder — an MRI may be recommended. MRI helps map the disease and is especially useful for planning treatment or surgery.           
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Step 4: Surgery (laparoscopy)</strong>        
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                For many years, laparoscopy was considered the “gold standard” for diagnosis. This minimally invasive surgery allows doctors to see endometriosis lesions directly and confirm them with biopsies. If deeper involvement is suspected — such as in the bowel or bladder — an MRI may be recommended. MRI helps map the disease and is especially useful for planning treatment or surgery.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Today, laparoscopy is still the most definitive way to diagnose endometriosis, but it’s used more selectively. If imaging is clear and symptoms respond to treatment, surgery may not be necessary right away — especially when the goal is symptom management rather than confirmation alone.

                <strong>Tests that don’t work well (yet)</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Blood tests like CA-125 are not reliable enough on their own. They can be normal in people with endometriosis or elevated for many unrelated reasons. Research into new markers (like microRNAs) is ongoing, but no blood test can currently diagnose endometriosis on its own.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Why the choose of a specialist matters?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Endometriosis is complex. Seeing a gynecologist with specific training in endometriosis can make a huge difference. Specialists are more familiar with subtle symptoms, advanced imaging, and individualized care — and can significantly shorten the time to diagnosis.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                In adolescents and young women, early evaluation is especially important. Starting treatment sooner may help reduce disease progression and protect future fertility.

                Endometriosis treatment is not one-size-fits-all. What helps one woman may not help another, and many of us try several approaches before finding what truly supports us.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Standard Medical Treatments</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Conventional treatment usually focuses on pain relief and hormone regulation. These options can be helpful for some women, especially at certain stages of life.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Common medical treatments include:<br>
                • Pain relief medications, such as NSAIDs, to reduce inflammation and discomfort<br>
                • Hormonal treatments, including birth control pills, progestins, hormonal IUDs, or GnRH analogues, which aim to suppress estrogen and slow lesion growth<br>
                • Surgical treatment, most often laparoscopy, to remove visible endometriosis lesions and scar tissue<br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                For some women, these treatments bring meaningful relief. For others, benefits may be temporary, incomplete, or come with side effects. Importantly, standard treatments often focus on managing symptoms, rather than addressing the broader inflammatory and immune aspects of the disease.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                And that's the approach that I want to share with all of you: A Whole-Body Approach to Living with Endometriosis
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">

                <strong>More than symptom control</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Traditional treatments often focus on suppressing hormones or managing pain. While these options can help some women, they don’t always address the deeper drivers of endometriosis — such as inflammation, immune imbalance, stress, and nervous system overload.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                A holistic approach looks beyond symptom relief and asks:<br>
                • What does your body need to feel safer?<br>
                • How can inflammation be reduced gently?<br>
                • How can the nervous system be supported?<br>
                • How can daily life become more manageable and meaningful?
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Building your support team</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Many women benefit from working with a team that may include:<br>
                • A gynecologist or endometriosis specialist<br>
                • A pelvic floor physiotherapist<br>
                • A nutritionist familiar with anti-inflammatory approaches<br>
                • A pain specialist<br>
                • A psychologist or therapist
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Mental and emotional health support is not optional — it is essential. Living with chronic pain affects mood, identity, relationships, and self-trust. Being supported emotionally is part of healing, not a sign of weakness.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>The role of holistic care</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Holistic treatment does not mean ignoring medical care. It means integrating tools that support the body and mind together, such as:<br>
                • Nourishing, anti-inflammatory food choices<br>
                • Gentle, consistent movement that respects pain limits<br>
                • Stress regulation and mindfulness practices<br>
                • Nervous system support<br>
                • Improving gut health and sleep quality

                <img src="images/guide-1.2-treatment.jpg" alt="Diagnosis of Endometriosis" class="centered-img">
                For many women, this approach brings something medication alone never did: a sense of peace and control.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Choosing what fits you best</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Endometriosis treatment is deeply personal. What helps one woman may not help another — and that is okay. Healing is not linear, and progress can be slow. The goal is not perfection, but a life that feels more livable, supported, and aligned with your values.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Ongoing research continues to explore gentler, non-hormonal options that target inflammation and immune pathways directly — offering real hope for the future.
