            <p class="body-text">
                Endometriosis is a chronic condition that affects around 10% of women and girls of reproductive age worldwide — that's about 190 million people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) in their 2025 fact sheet. It happens when tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus (the endometrium) grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, bladder, or the pelvic lining. This tissue acts just like the normal endometrium: it thickens, breaks down, and tries to bleed with every menstrual cycle. But because it's trapped with no way out, it causes inflammation, irritation, scarring, and adhesions — sticky bands of tissue that can make organs pull or stick together painfully.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The main symptom everyone talks about is pain, and it's usually pelvic pain that can feel different for every person. Many describe it as a deep, throbbing ache in the lower belly, lower back, or thighs. This pain often gets much worse right before and during periods, turning what might be mild cramps for others into something truly debilitating. Severe period pain, called dysmenorrhea, is one of the earliest and most common signs. It can start as soon as periods begin in the teenage years, and for many, it's far more intense than "normal" cramps — sometimes so bad that it forces missing school, work, sports, or social events. Studies from Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic show that this pain can be constant or come in waves, and it's not always tied just to periods; it can linger all month long.

                Pain affects everything: school attendance, jobs, friendships, self-confidence. Fatigue makes simple tasks hard. Heavy bleeding causes embarrassment. Sexual pain strains partnerships. Infertility brings grief. Mental health suffers from feeling "crazy" or unheard when doctors say "it's just periods."

        <!-- Causes Tab -->
        <div id="causes" class="tab-content">
            <p class="body-text">
                The causes of endometriosis are still not fully pinned down — it's a puzzle with many pieces, likely different for different people. Experts agree it's multifactorial, meaning genetics, hormones, immune problems, environment, and more all play roles. Recent 2025 research from UC San Francisco big data studies and Oxford genetic analyses show strong links to immune and inflammatory pathways, plus comorbidities like Crohn's or migraines.

            <!-- ... (rest of your Causes text) ... -->
            <p class="body-text">
                The more we understand these pieces, the closer we get to new, non-hormonal treatments that target inflammation or the immune response directly—offering hope for gentler, more effective options.

        <!-- Diagnosis Tab -->
        <div id="diagnosis" class="tab-content">
            <p class="body-text">
                Diagnosing endometriosis can be really challenging, and that's one of the reasons many people wait so long—on average 7 to 10 years—to get an answer, according to guidelines from organizations like ESHRE (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology) and ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). In teenagers and young women, the delay is often even longer because severe period pain is frequently dismissed as "normal." The symptoms are nonspecific—they overlap with many other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic inflammatory disease, or even just stress—so doctors can't rely on symptoms alone to be sure.

                You deserve answers, and the right doctor will listen and take the steps needed to find them.

        <!-- Treatment Tab -->
        <div id="treatment" class="tab-content">
            <p class="body-text">
                Although there’s no cure for endometriosis yet, there are many effective ways to manage pain, improve fertility chances, and enhance overall quality of life. Treatment is always personalized—it depends on how severe your symptoms are, your age, whether you want to get pregnant now or later, and how you respond to different options. The goal is to reduce inflammation, control lesion growth, and give you relief while minimizing side effects.
