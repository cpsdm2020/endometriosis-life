                Lifestyle changes have been one of the most powerful tools in managing my endometriosis — not as a cure, but as a way to reduce inflammation, support hormone balance, and improve daily quality of life.            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Food, in particular, became a way to care for my body instead of constantly fighting it. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               There is no single “endometriosis diet” that works for everyone. Research and lived experience both suggest that anti-inflammatory, hormone-supportive nutrition can make a meaningful difference for many women.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               <strong>Endometriosis-supportive way of eating</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Rather than strict rules, I think of this as a supportive framework — something you adapt to your body, culture, and lifestyle. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Foods that often support women with endometriosis include: <br>
                • Leafy greens (spinach, kale, arugula)<br>
                • Colorful vegetables and berries<br>
                • Fatty fish rich in omega-3s (salmon, sardines, mackerel)<br>
                • Olive oil, nuts, and seeds<br>
                • Anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric and ginger<br>
                • Whole grains and fiber-rich foods that support gut and estrogen metabolism
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <img src="images/lifestyle-diet-1.01.jpg" alt="diet1" class="centered-img"> 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              These foods help calm inflammation, support the gut microbiome, and assist the body in processing hormones more efficiently.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               <strong>Foods that may worsen symptoms</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Many women notice symptom flares with certain foods — especially those that promote inflammation or hormone imbalance. Common triggers may include:<br>
                • Highly processed foods<br>
                • Refined sugar<br>
                • Excess caffeine<br>
                • Alcohol<br>
                • Red or processed meat<br>
                • Trans fats
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                This doesn’t mean these foods are “bad” or forbidden. It simply means paying attention to how your body responds and adjusting with compassion, not restriction.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              <strong>Specific dietary approaches often explored  </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Some women find relief by experimenting with structured approaches, such as:<br>
                • Anti-inflammatory diet<br>
                • Mediterranean-style diet<br>
                • Low FODMAP (if digestive symptoms are prominent)<br>
                • Gluten or dairy reduction (especially in cases of sensitivity)
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <img src="images/lifestyle-diet-1.02.jpg" alt="diet1" class="centered-img"> 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                These approaches can be helpful starting points — not lifelong obligations. Working with a nutritionist experienced in endometriosis can help personalize them safely.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              For me, the biggest shift wasn’t eliminating certain foods — it was changing my relationship with eating. I stopped aiming for perfection and started aiming for consistency and kindness.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Food should support healing, not create stress or guilt. Small, sustainable changes matter far more than strict rules.   
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Gentle, regular movement can help reduce endometriosis pain, ease inflammation, improve circulation in the pelvic area, and boost endorphins for better mood.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Low-impact activities are best: walking in nature, yoga (especially restorative or yin), swimming, Pilates, or light strength training.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Avoid high-intensity workouts during flare-ups — honor your body's limits and rest when needed. Consistency over intensity is key.

            <p class="body-text">
               <strong>Supporting the nervous system  </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               Living with endometriosis is stressful — emotionally, physically, and mentally. The pain is unpredictable, the fatigue can be overwhelming, and the feeling of not being understood can weigh heavily over time. Stress is not the cause of endometriosis, but it can amplify symptoms and make the body feel constantly on edge. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               When stress becomes chronic, cortisol levels remain elevated. This can increase inflammation, disrupt hormone balance, and worsen pain and fatigue. Supporting the nervous system is therefore not optional — it is an essential part of living well with endometriosis. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               <strong>Gentle daily practices that can help </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Stress management doesn’t require long meditation sessions or dramatic lifestyle changes. Often, it’s the small, consistent practices that bring the most relief.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Many women find support through:<br>
                • Slow, deep breathing or nervous-system–focused exercises<br>
                • Meditation or mindfulness apps<br>
                • Journaling thoughts and emotions<br>
                • Spending time in nature or sunlight<br>
                • Gentle movement such as stretching, yoga, or walking  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              These practices help signal safety to the body, allowing muscles to relax and inflammation to soften over time.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
               <strong>Emotional support</strong> 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Chronic pain affects mental health deeply. Anxiety, low mood, frustration, and grief are common — and completely understandable. Seeking psychological support is not a sign that the pain is “in your head.” It is a way to care for the mind–body connection that endometriosis so strongly affects.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              A therapist familiar with chronic illness can help process emotions, reduce stress responses, and rebuild trust in your body.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              <strong>Define your boundaries </strong>   
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Learning to set boundaries is one of the hardest — and most healing — steps. Saying no, resting without guilt, asking for help, and protecting your energy are not indulgences. They are acts of self-preservation.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              Self-care is not about bubble baths or perfection. It’s about listening honestly to what your body needs and honoring it — even when it’s uncomfortable to do so. You don’t need to eliminate stress to heal. You just need enough moments of safety and rest for your body to recover.
