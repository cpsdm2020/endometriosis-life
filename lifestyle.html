        <p class="body-text">
            Lifestyle changes have been one of the most powerful tools in managing my endometriosis — not as a cure, but as a way to reduce inflammation, balance hormones, and improve daily quality of life.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            Small, sustainable shifts in diet, movement, sleep, and stress management can make a profound difference over time. Anti-inflammatory foods, gentle exercise, restful routines, and mindfulness practices all play a role.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            This section shares what has worked for me and what research supports — from nourishing meal ideas to movement that honors your body’s limits, better sleep hygiene, and practical ways to lower chronic stress.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Every body is different. The goal is to experiment kindly, listen deeply, and find what helps you feel stronger, calmer, and more in tune with yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            You deserve to feel good in your body, even on hard days. These lifestyle tools are here to support you in building a life that feels lighter, despite endometriosis.
