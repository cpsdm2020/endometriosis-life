        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I always felt pain! Long before I was diagnosed, I lived with the sharp, exhausting pain that doctors sometimes dismissed, friends didn’t understand, and I learned to hide from myself. Feeling pain is "normal", "it is part of being a women", or so I was told.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until I was 27 that I finally got a name for it: endometriosis. By then, I had already endured years of uncertainty, countless pills, hormonal treatments, and even a laparoscopy to remove tumors that kept coming back. Over the years, I also relied on countless painkillers—paracetamol, diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, even morphine. And while morphine can numb the pain, it is not a way to live. 
Nothing truly healed me. I felt frustrated, exhausted, and at times, hopeless. </p>
        <p>I realized that managing endometriosis meant more than chasing symptom relief—it meant listening to my body, nurturing it, and finding balance in ways I had never tried before. That’s when I turned to a holistic approach: mindful eating, consistent movement, and daily practices that quieted my mind. Slowly, I began to feel peace, and for the first time, I noticed real improvements—not just in pain, but in the way my body responded and healed.</p>
        <p>This page is my attempt to share that journey with you—my experience of living with endometriosis. I want other women to know they are not alone. You are not failing, your pain is valid, and there are ways to have a good life with a chronical illness like endometriosis.</p>
        <p>In addition to my personal experiences, this page is built on years of research. I have read thousands of scientific articles, studied holistic approaches, and continue to educate myself to provide accurate, evidence-based information. My goal is to help others navigate endometriosis with knowledge, support, and hope.</p>
        <p>I also write this for the women who feel unseen, unheard, or isolated. For the ones who lie awake at night wondering if anyone understands. For the ones who want to take back control of their health. If my story can give even one person hope, or remind them that they are not alone, then sharing it is worth everything.</p>
        <p>With Love, <p>
        <p>Sophie <p>
