            <button class="accordion-question">What is endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Endometriosis is a long-term condition in which tissue resembling the uterine lining grows in other parts of the body. This tissue responds to menstrual cycle hormones, leading to inflammation, painful symptoms, and the formation of scar tissue.</p>
                <p>It most often appears on the pelvic peritoneum and can affect the ovaries or other organs in the pelvis, such as the bowel or bladder. In rarer cases, it may develop outside the pelvic area, for example in the thorax.</p>
                <p>The condition impacts around 1 in 10 women and people assigned female at birth during their reproductive years, though effects can continue beyond. It affects individuals from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities equally.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What causes endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>The exact cause remains unknown. It is not related to anything you have or haven't done. Possible factors include genetics, environmental influences, and anatomical issues. Several theories exist, but more research is needed.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Is endometriosis a type of cancer?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>No, endometriosis is not cancer. It is a benign condition. While any tissue in the body has a small potential to become cancerous, the risk of endometriosis developing into cancer is very low.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Can endometriosis be prevented?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>At present, there is no known prevention for endometriosis. However, symptoms and disease progression can often be managed effectively through various approaches.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Who does endometriosis affect?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Contrary to some myths, endometriosis does not only impact certain groups, such as white women in their 30s who have postponed pregnancy. It affects people of all ethnicities and backgrounds, typically from puberty through to menopause, with ongoing effects possible in some cases.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Can changes to diet or nutrition ease endometriosis symptoms?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Although strong scientific evidence is limited, some individuals find dietary adjustments helpful for reducing symptoms like bloating or discomfort, especially related to bowel involvement. Responses vary greatly between people.</p>
                <p>Concerns about soya and its plant oestrogens are common, but significant effects would require extremely high consumption. Ongoing research explores nutrition's role in symptom management.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What about environmental toxins like dioxins and endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Dioxins are pollutants released from certain industrial processes. Some studies in animals suggest high exposure might contribute to endometriosis by affecting the immune or reproductive systems, but this link has not been confirmed in humans.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">How do I find a specialist for endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Due to legal guidelines, specific doctors or centres cannot be recommended individually. Start by discussing with your GP, who may know local experts in pelvic pain or endometriosis.</p>
                <p>The British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (BSGE) maintains a list of accredited centres that meet high standards for complex cases, with annual reviews.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">How can I get a second opinion?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>If you feel uneasy with your current advice or treatment, you are entitled to seek another view. Discuss this with your GP, who can arrange a referral. Clear communication is important—ask for explanations if needed—or consider switching GPs if necessary.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">How can I manage pain from endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Various pain management techniques exist, including medication and lifestyle strategies. Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen may work best when started before expected pain peaks, such as a few days prior to menstruation.</p>
                <p>Some people benefit from antidepressants for chronic pain, as they can influence pain signals in the brain. Self-management courses for chronic conditions are also available and can be accessed via your GP.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What to expect after laparoscopy?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Recovery varies—some feel better quickly, while others need weeks. Mild soreness is common, especially with more involved surgery. Full recovery can take up to 8 weeks. Contact your doctor if pain is severe or concerns arise.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Can I become pregnant with endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Endometriosis is linked to fertility challenges in some cases, but many people conceive naturally—around 60-70% do so without assistance. If trying to conceive, consult a specialist early for personalised options.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Does pregnancy cure endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Pregnancy does not cure endometriosis. Some experience temporary relief due to paused periods, but symptoms can persist or return afterward. Scar tissue may also cause discomfort as the body changes. Decisions about family planning should be based on your readiness.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Why is intercourse painful, and does it worsen the condition?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Painful sex is a frequent symptom but does not aggravate the disease itself, though it may temporarily increase discomfort. Open discussion with a healthcare provider and your partner can help explore relief options.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What if I'm struggling to conceive?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Speak to your doctor for guidance on next steps, which may include fertility assessments or treatments.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Where can I find support for endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Support is available through helplines, online communities, local groups, and forums. Feeling isolated is common—connecting with others who understand can help. For low mood, professional listening services are also accessible.</p>
                <p>Sharing information with loved ones or directing them to resources can improve understanding and support.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">Should I have treatment for endometriosis?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Treatment choices are personal and should be discussed thoroughly with your healthcare provider, considering symptoms, disease extent, fertility goals, and potential side effects.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What treatment options are available?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Options vary and may include medication, surgery, or complementary approaches like physiotherapy or acupuncture. Some find lifestyle changes beneficial. The best approach is individualised.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-question">What about endometriosis after hysterectomy or menopause?</button>
            <div class="accordion-answer">
                <p>Symptoms often ease after menopause due to lower oestrogen levels, though some residual effects from scar tissue may persist. Recurrence is possible but less common post-menopause. Hysterectomy alone does not cure the condition, as disease exists outside the uterus; combining with excision of lesions reduces risk.</p>
